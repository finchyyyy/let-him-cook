# let-him-cook
This project aims to iterate upon the classic 2D fighting game formula with a couple extra liberties taken,
and provide the possibility to create new fighting games using its code.
Basically: **MUGEN, but better.**

Codebase will consist of C++ code and whatever I need to make it into a finished product.
As of right now, the extra linking and other stuff required to actually run the program exist only on my own computer as a Visual Studio project.
This is lame, and I am working to remove it from its VS shackles. Don't hold your breath, though. Let Me Cook ;]

I am using SFML 2.6 for rendering graphics and accepting keyboard input for now (yes, I know SFML 3.0 exists. It did not exist when i started this project.)
If I can be bothered to learn it I may migrate to raylib, or i might get so bored I might finally research what DirectX is.

I am almost at the phase where I can start properly creating characters to inhabit my game. I have a couple concepts lined up...  
  Pan Man - a traditional shoto, but he was given a frying pan. Good normals with a stun mechanic if he hits with his pan.
  Barby - normal-based zoner that can transition into a projectile-based one. Fights with a spatula and a BBQ full of food. Will make a girl if I get better at animation.
  Shawarmageddon - big body that fights with an even bigger kebab; bossman is here to give you a hug- wait nononononononono
  Hard Boil - He throws eggs. Like, really hard. But sometimes less hard, so he can hit them at you from a different angle.
  Noodle (name WIP) - his noodles are long and his attacks are longer. uses his noodle to traverse the stage in tricky ways and has a high-reward command grab.
